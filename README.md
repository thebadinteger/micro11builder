# Micro11Builder

A script to make your own Micro11 image.

This is a script to automate the build of an Micro11 iso.
The main goal of this is to use only Microsoft utilities like DISM, and nothing external. The only executable included is oscdimg.exe, which is provided in the Windows ADK and it is used to create bootable ISO images. Also included is an unattended answer file, which is used to bypass the MS account on OOBE.

To download the post-setup, you will need git If you don't want to install it, you can skip the step

Instructions:

1. Download an Windows 11 ISO.
2. Mount the downloaded ISO image using Windows Explorer.
3. Run the micro11builder.bat file (or micro11builder_copilot.bat if you want Copilot).
4. Select the drive letter where the image is mounted (only the letter, no colon ":")
5. Select the SKU that you want the image to be based.
6. Sit back and relax :)
7. When the image is completed, you will see it in the folder where the script was extracted, with the name micro11.iso

Known issues:

1. Only the x64 .iso supported as of now. This can be easily fixable by the end user, just by replacing every instance of en-us with the language needed (like ro-RO and so on), and every x64 instance with arm64.
2. You cannot change the system language.
